        <h1>Terms & Condition</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>The repairing of your gadget(s) after collection will take at most 24 working hours. It may take longer, depending on the availability of parts and other accessories/services.</li>
            <li>If a gadget requires a component replacement, the customers have to bear the cost of the component. Our customer service team will call you exclusively to take your approval before we replace any components.</li>
            <li>In case the gadget is given in a completely non-functional condition with no power/no display, we’ll revert with the exact diagnosis and the list of the parts gone bad after a thorough check-up. We follow a decision tree approach to repair a problem and it could be quite possible that we may contact you more than once to get your revised approval of additional parts.</li>
            <li> We charge a diagnosis/handling fee of Rs 200, in case the customer requests for the return of the device after refusal of the repair and its cost. In case a customer has provided the approval but we are unable to repair or source the part, we return the gadget without charging any handling fee.</li>
            <li>The company will take responsibility of a repaired gadget for 7 days after it is fixed if the delivery is not claimed by the customer. Following that, the company will not be responsible for any loss or damage to the gadget.</li>

            <li>RepairBuy requests all its customers to fully ensure and sign the quality checklist before giving/taking handover of their device at the time of pickup or drop. Any problems unrelated to the repair will not be our responsibility, post the customer’s acceptance of the repaired device.</li>
            <li>Warranty will be given only for replaced and repaired parts.</li>

            <li>A Standby gadget will be provided by RepairBuy till the repairs are completed. After the gadget is fixed, if the customer does not claim his gadget, he/she has to pay Rs 100 every day as a rental for the standby gadget.</li>
